Hi, I’m George. I’m a software engineer based in Edinburgh, UK. I primarily work with Ruby on Rails as part of a product engineering team. I’m also experienced with the Hotwire stack, including Stimulus and Turbo.

Before software engineering, I studied computer science at the University of Birmingham, where I researched conformity to social pressure in online behaviour.
